      	<br />
        <p>A common complaint heard on the Carnegie Mellon University campus is that the Pittsburgh buses do not run efficiently. This analysis aimed to determine the optimal scheduling of buses for the Pittsburgh bus system. To do so, data from the Port Authority of Allegheny County was used to build and constrain a model.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The model indicated that, given our assumptions, the current bus scheduling by the Port Authority is non optimal. This suggests a need for further analysis, using a more extensive model to test whether or not the simplified model in this report gives an accurate result. If these same conclusions are reflected in the complex model, it would mean that the Pittsburgh buses are potentially wasting people's time and money unnecessarily.</p>
