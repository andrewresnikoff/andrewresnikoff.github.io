		<p>
			In today's society, diamonds are seen as a luxury item. They are a very important part of popular jewelry. Probably because of how difficult it is to mine diamonds, there is only a small group of companies that participate in most of the diamond trade. These companies can then set diamond whatever prices they like, making diamonds incredibly expensive.

			Through this investigation, we hoped to get a better understanding of how diamonds are priced. From 285 diamond samples we used multivariate linear regression to find a relationship between 10 different predictor variables and the price of a diamond. In our conclusions, we found that not all of these predictors were significant. Interestingly, while the weight in carats of a diamond was significant we concluded that increasing the weight of a diamond corresponds to a decrease in price. Based on our analysis, increasing the width of a diamond will correspond to an increase in price.
