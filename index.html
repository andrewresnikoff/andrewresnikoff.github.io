      <h3>Analysis of Diamond Pricing</h3>
      <b>Abstract:</b>
      <p>In today's society, diamonds are seen as a luxury item. They are a very important part of popular jewelry. Probably because of how difficult it is to mine diamonds, there is only a small group of companies that participate in most of the diamond trade. These companies can then set diamond whatever prices they like, making diamonds incredibly expensive. Through this investigation, we hoped to get a better understanding of how diamonds are priced. From 285 diamond samples we used multivariate linear regression to find a relationship between 10 different predictor variables and the price of a diamond. In our conclusions, we found that not all of these predictors were significant. Interestingly, while the weight in carats of a diamond was significant we concluded that increasing the weight of a diamond corresponds to a decrease in price. Based on our analysis, increasing the width of a diamond will correspond to an increase in price.</p>

      <h3>Analysis of Blog Traffic</h3>
      <b>Abstract:</b>
      <p>Since blogging has become popular, it is interesting to see how the number of comments vary for different blog posts so that we can understand what drives web traffic to certain posts rather than others. In this investigation, multivariate linear regression was used to determine what affects the number of comments a blog post gets 24 hours after a given basetime. Starting with a sample of 668 blog posts and 27 potential predictors, we eliminated outliers and insignificant variables to build a final model. In this model, we discovered that certain words can either cause an expected increase or decrease in the number of comments in those 24 hours. We also found that posts with more comments 24 hours before the basetime (for the source average or the post itself) are expected to have more comments after the basetime.</p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
