			<div class="card-content">
				<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In today's society, diamonds are seen as a luxury item. They are a very important part of popular jewelry. Probably because of how difficult it is to mine diamonds, there is only a small group of companies that participate in most of the diamond trade. These companies can then set diamond whatever prices they like, making diamonds incredibly expensive.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>

					Through this investigation, we hoped to get a better understanding of how diamonds are priced. From 285 diamond samples we used multivariate linear regression to find a relationship between 10 different predictor variables and the price of a diamond. In our conclusions, we found that not all of these predictors were significant. Interestingly, while the weight in carats of a diamond was significant we concluded that increasing the weight of a diamond corresponds to a decrease in price. Based on our analysis, increasing the width of a diamond will correspond to an increase in price.

				<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
				<br />
				<p>

					Since blogging has become popular, it is interesting to see how the number of comments vary for different blog posts so that we can understand what drives web traffic to certain posts rather than others. In this investigation, multivariate linear regression was used to determine what affects the number of comments a blog post gets 24 hours after a given basetime. 
					Starting with a sample of 668 blog posts and 27 potential predictors, we eliminated outliers and insignificant variables to build a final model. In this model, we discovered that certain words can either cause an expected increase or decrease in the number of comments in those 24 hours. We also found that posts with more comments 24 hours before the basetime (for the source average or the post itself) are expected to have more comments after the basetime.

				<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
				<br />
				<p>
					As times change, ideas change with it. As new ideas are put forward, it is often difficult to change the minds of those around you. This analysis will look at many different political movements and how whether or not the movement was non violent ultimately affected the end result. Through this investigation, we aim to determine whether non violent movements are more likely to be successful ones and which factors are significant in determining whether violent and non violent movement will be successful.

				<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In this investigation, we aimed to better understand the relationship between the number of spikes that occur in a short time period, a specific action and the nuerons associated with that action. Using neuron spike data observed every 100ms from monkeys, we built a factor model to recover the velocities at which these monkeys moved their hands.

			<div class="card-content">
				<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
				<br />
				<p>
					In the 1950's, the antibiotic tetracycline started being used by group of doctors in Illinois. Through this analysis, we will explore the "viral marketing" effect by examining how this antibiotic managed to spread among this group of doctors. In this investigation, we conclude that the social network between doctors will have a positive affect on the rate at which tetracycline is adopted.

				<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Many popular websites use advertisements to generate revenue for the site. Some users would prefer to use these sites without having to look at these advertisements, so they employ an “ad-blocker” to remove these advertisements from the page. Through this analysis, we aim to build a model that can successfully determine which images on a page are ads. Using this model, we can predict whether or not an image is an advertisement (and an actual ad blocking service could then actually block the image on the site.)

			<div class="card-content">
				<p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
				<br />
				<p>
					A common complaint heard on the Carnegie Mellon University campus is that the Pittsburgh buses do not run efficiently. This analysis aimed to determine the optimal scheduling of buses for the Pittsburgh bus system. To do so, data from the Port Authority of Allegheny County was used to build and constrain a model.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>

					The model indicated that, given our assumptions, the current bus scheduling by the Port Authority is non optimal. This suggests a need for further analysis, using a more extensive model to test whether or not the simplified model in this report gives an accurate result. If these same conclusions are reflected in the complex model, it would mean that the Pittsburgh buses are potentially wasting people's time and money unnecessarily.
